Sending a notification:

[{
  notification: {
    name: LISTENER_NAME,
    for_addresses: [HASH], // Might be two if we listen for the sending and receiving address
    type: 'new_transaction',
    transaction: {
      txid: HASH,
      confirmations: 1,
      totalIn: 100,
      totalOut: 102,
      fee: 2,
      type: 'sent',
      sender_address: HASH,
      receiver_address: HASH,
      amount: FLOAT,
      
      // Is the below even needed?
      inputs: [{
        transaction: HASH,
        index: INT,
        address: ADDRESS,
        amount: FLOAT,
      }],
      outputs: [{
        address: ADDRESS,
        amount: FLOAT,
      }]
    }
  }
}]

[{
  notification: {
    for_address: HASH,
    type: 'new_confirmation',
    ...
  }
}]

API stuff

add_listener
  name: LISTENER_NAME
  url: URL_FOR_POST
  addresses: [HASHES] // if not using default addresses
  min_confirmations: 0 // Let me know when it first pops up -- default is 1
  max_confirmations: 1 // Stop notifying me once it's been confirmed -- default
  // events: ["new_transaction", "new_confirmation"]

listen_once
  url: URL,
  sender: ADDRESS,
  receiver: ADDRESS,
  amount: FLOAT
  min_confirmations: 0,
  max_confirmations: 1

E.g., tell me when this transaction pops up, and when it gets confirmed. Then forget it.
