# TODO

Tentative. Just trying to get the general plan across.

 * Fix parseTxs()
 
 * Listen for new transactions, even ones with no
   confirmations, and parse them.
   
 * If someone gets a mining bounty, that should
   register as a transaction for them somehow
   
 * Listen for new confirmations
 
 * Switch the node to the testnet
 
 * Make a Rails app that uses the same DB. It will
   let people sign up and will function as the API
   interface.
   
 * When Node app finds a new transaction, it should
   Look at the DB to see if anyone is listening for
   any addresses contained in the transaction. If
   so, it should POST the data to the users.
