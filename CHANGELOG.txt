# CHANGELOG

Read this from top to bottom. You should have a good
understanding of BitCoin transactions, which you can read
up on here:

  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transactions

Otherwise, the code, and my descriptions, will seem
like a meaningless, neuron-killing madness.

## 2011/09/07

To run the app, run:

  $ node app.js

This will make a new client, start it, and spew a ton of
output into the terminal. It will take a LONG TIME before
all the blocks load, so sit tight. And the output will be
very boring because most of the early blocks appear to be
only 50 BTC mining bounties, so there's nothing to parse.

Okay, so the main code now is the parseTxs() function.
This takes one or a list of transactions and digs up
some data related to them for the DB. It's based on the
getOutpoints() function from scratchpaper.js, which I
copied from the source for node-bitcoin-explorer. I added
plenty of comments to it so I could understand what was
going on there.

Anyway, parseTxs(), once it finds the relevant data,
will start adding some useful properties to each tx.

 * totalIn   BigInt, total value of inputs
 * totalOut  BigInt, total value of outputs
 * inputs    Array of input objects
 * ouputs    Array of output objects

I'm creating input and output objects to conveniently
summarize the transaction information that is useful
if you are interested in determining if a transaction
relates to any of your addresses or not.

Input object:

 * transactionHash    The transaction's hash
 * index              Index of transaction outpoint
                      that corresponds to this input
 * address            Sender's Bitcoin address
 * value              BigInt of transaction value
 * btc                Regular transaction value

The output object is very similar:

  * address
  * index
  * value
  * btc

Okay, it looks like there is something wrong with
parseTxs() because I saw some non-mining bounty
transactions and I didn't see the special data that I
added.

(Yeah, I'm still trying to download the blockchain).
